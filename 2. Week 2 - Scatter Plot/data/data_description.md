# Week 2 Data Description

For this week's tutorial, we have extracted run metrics to visualize the relationship between distance and pace.

## Source Data

The source data contains individual run records. We have extracted the distance and derived the average pace for each run.

## Extracted Data: `distance_vs_pace.csv`

Each row represents a single run.

### Columns:

- `Distance`: The total distance of the run (in km).
- `AveragePace`: The average pace of the run (in min/km).

### Example Data:

| Distance | AveragePace |
| :------- | :---------- |
| 5.03     | 4.45        |
| 10.12    | 5.10        |
